# Configurator — Implementation Spec

Scope: the **Configure** screen. Docs, Share and Settings get a route + empty shell.
Design source of truth: `.claude-design/README.md` + `.claude-design/design/Configurator v5.dc.html`,
with `.claude-design/screens/*.png` (2–4× captures at a 1741px viewport) as the visual reference
every §8 adaptation below is measured against.

> **v5 supersedes v2.** The earlier warm-paper, rounded, sliding-highlight language is gone. This
> document describes what is built now; §8 records where the implementation deliberately departs
> from the design files.

## 1. Architecture

### Package layout

| Package                      | Owns                                                                                    |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `packages/matrix`            | Vendored CLI catalog, zod schemas, the read model, stack expansion. Pure TS — no React. |
| `packages/ui`                | The design system: tokens + 11 primitives. No app knowledge.                            |
| `packages/typescript-config` | `base` / `react-library` / `vite-app` / `node` tsconfigs.                               |
| `packages/eslint-config`     | `base` / `react-library` / `react-app` flat configs.                                    |
| `packages/prettier-config`   | The single Prettier config, declared once in the root `package.json`.                   |
| `apps/web`                   | Routes, stores, feature components, derivations, the GitHub API seam.                   |

`noUnusedLocals` / `noUnusedParameters` stay unset everywhere — every workspace holds code it does
not author (vendored CLI types, generated icon map), and tsc has no per-directory escape. ESLint's
`no-unused-vars` covers it and can scope.

### Data flow

```
BUILT_IN_MATRIX + AGENT_DEFINITIONS + STACK_PRELOADS   (packages/matrix/src/{vendor,generated})
  └─ packages/matrix/src/schema           zod safeParse at module init
      └─ packages/matrix/src/read-model   domain → category → skill tree, sub-agents, stacks
          └─ export { CATALOG, SUB_AGENT_GROUPS, STACKS, expandStack } from "@workspace/matrix"
              ├─ apps/web/stores/config-store          user configuration  (persisted)
              ├─ apps/web/stores/added-skills-store    session skills      (NOT persisted)
              ├─ router search params                  view state
              └─ apps/web/features/configure/lib/derive.ts → view data
                  └─ components
```

`apps/web` imports **only** from `@workspace/matrix`. The package validates once at its own
boundary, so the app performs no second parse.

### Decisions

| Question     | Decision                                                       | Rationale                                                         |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Router       | `@tanstack/react-router` v1, code-based routes                 | `validateSearch` + zod gives a typed, validated URL boundary.     |
| Table        | **Removed.** `@tanstack/react-table` is gone.                  | v5 renders skills as grid cells; there is no table left to build. |
| Server state | No react-query. One `fetch` behind `lib/api/github-skills.ts`. | Adopt on the second API call.                                     |
| Icons        | `simple-icons` (raw path data) + hand-checked map              | Drawn in `currentColor`, never brand colour — see §4 rule 4.      |

---

## 2. Design language

Five rules generate almost everything, and every primitive in `packages/ui` exists to serve one:

1. **No border radius anywhere.** `--radius: 0px`, so the whole derived shadcn ladder is 0.
2. **Borders only where they mean something.** Cell hairlines collapse into a shared lattice; the
   only real border in a group is the selected cell's amber outline.
3. **Two typefaces, strictly divided.** Inter for human names and descriptions; IBM Plex Mono for
   every label, id, badge, count and command, uppercase with wide tracking.
4. **One accent colour.** Amber marks what the user deliberately chose or changed. Hover states stay
   neutral, and skill logos render in `currentColor` rather than their brand colour. There is no
   second signal colour: a skill the selection has ruled out is dimmed, not reddened — see §7.
5. **Whitespace, not rules, separates content.** Two kinds of horizontal rule exist: the full-bleed
   section divider and the collapsed cell lattice.

**The app must never restyle a primitive locally.** shadcn's semantic vars are remapped onto the v5
palette in `:root`, so generated components inherit the language without per-component overrides.

---

## 3. State

### Config store — `apps/web/src/stores/config-store.ts` (persisted, v2)

```ts
type Assignment = {
  load: "lazy" | "preloaded"
  enabled: boolean // a roster row switched off keeps its load mode and its row
}

type SkillEntry = {
  model: "opus" | "fable" | "sonnet" | "haiku"
  effort: "low" | "medium" | "high" | "xhigh" | "max" | "ultra"
  install: "plugin" | "eject"
  scope: "project" | "global"
  assignments: Record<AgentId, Assignment>
}

type ConfigState = {
  stackId: string | null // null = "Start from scratch"
  skills: Partial<Record<SkillId, SkillEntry>> // SPARSE — presence *is* selection
  remembered: Partial<Record<SkillId, SkillEntry>> // deselected, not discarded
  pins: Partial<Record<AgentId, boolean>> // explicit agent on/off overrides
}
```

**Selecting assigns automatically.** A fresh selection arrives with the rule's assignments
(`lib/default-assignments.ts`): the core roles (developer · pm · reviewer · tester) of the
skill's domain, `shared` reaching every implementation domain, `meta` never implicit; loads
default lazy except the matrix's `required` / `*-framework` categories (preloaded) and testing
skills (preloaded only on their own tester). An agent is **on** when a pin says so, else when
it holds ≥ 1 enabled skill (`isAgentOn`) — selecting a skill is what switches its agents on,
and the roster flashes the agents a selection just reached.

**Deselecting is not destructive.** One click removes a skill; the configuration behind it can be a
dozen — nine sub-agent assignments, a model, an effort — and the cell gives no warning, because
deselect reads as "not included" rather than "erase my work". A deselected entry moves to
`remembered` and is restored if the skill is selected again.

One rule covers both cases, with no special case per category: _a skill remembers how you configured
it; a skill you have never configured starts blank._ An exclusive swap evicts the sibling, which is
a deselection the user did not click, so it keeps the same promise — pick Vue over React and React
returns configured when you pick it back, while Vue starts blank because it has never been
configured.

Two boundaries stop this becoming a leak. `isWorthRemembering` drops entries that carry no
information at all — default options, no assignments — which is what a blank skill selected and
immediately deselected looks like; note that a stack-applied skill arrives _with_ assignments and so
is always remembered. And `applyStack` clears the map, because it is the explicit start-over action
and already confirms first when edits would be lost.

Derivations take `ConfigSelection` (`stackId` + `skills`), never `PersistedConfig`. A remembered
skill must not appear in a grid, a roster line, a count or the install inventory, and excluding it
at the type level means that cannot happen by accident.

`assignments` is the **single source of truth**. Per-cell agent counts, the roster panel and the
install inventory are all derived and none of them stores a copy — the prototype duplicated these
and they drifted.

There is no `selected` boolean (presence in the map means selected) and no `targetAgentIds`
(assignment is per-skill in the options panel, not a global target set).

### Added-skills store — `apps/web/src/stores/added-skills-store.ts` (**not** persisted)

Session-only skills pulled in from GitHub. `config-store`'s `partialize` strips any selection
referencing one, so nothing reaches localStorage that the next session could not describe. Selecting
one is allowed because `toggleSkill`'s catalog guard widens to "catalog **or** session".

### UI store — `apps/web/src/stores/ui-store.ts`

`openPanelSkillId` · `pendingStackId` · `dialog` · `rosterCollapsed` (per-domain accordion
map, the only persisted field) · `flashedAgentIds` (the roster pulse, decays after 2.6s).

`stuck` is deliberately **not** here — see §6.

### Persistence

| Concern    | Approach                                                                                                                         |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Key        | `agents-inc:config:v1` / `agents-inc:ui:v1`                                                                                      |
| Validation | `merge` → `safeParse`; on failure **return current** (silent reset, log in dev)                                                  |
| Stale ids  | `pruneUnknownIds` drops skill/stack/agent ids absent from the regenerated catalog (pins included)                                |
| Migration  | `PERSIST_VERSION = 5` (v5 adds `pins` + per-assignment `enabled`). Pre-release policy: no migrations — older blobs are discarded |

### URL search params — `/`

| Param    | Zod                                      | Default | Note                                                     |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `domain` | `z.enum(DOMAINS).nullable().catch(null)` | `null`  | `null` renders every domain — the design's resting state |
| `q`      | `z.string().trim().max(64).catch("")`    | `""`    |                                                          |
| `rec`    | `z.boolean().catch(false)`               | `false` |                                                          |
| `sel`    | `z.boolean().catch(false)`               | `false` | Narrow to what you have actually chosen                  |

## 5. Sizing

**Every dimension is `rem`, and `:root { font-size }` in `globals.css` is the single knob that
scales the whole design.** It is currently `110%` — the design's native size, 10% larger. The type
scale, the arbitrary metrics and Tailwind's own spacing utilities all resolve against it, so nothing
scales independently.

Two things stay in `px` on purpose:

- **Borders and the 1px lattice hairlines.** At 1.1px they render as blurry sub-pixel lines, and the
  collapsed grid is the entire visual language.
- **Viewport units**, so the sticky rails stay exactly one screen tall.

This is also why the app is not simply CSS `zoom`, which would scale both.

`60px` is the page's structural constant — main-column padding, the air above and below every
divider, and the roster's top padding — exposed as `--spacing-gutter` so `-mx-gutter` bleeds a rule
out to touch both vertical dividers.

### Where logic lives

Four layers, in order of preference. Nothing that could sit lower sits higher.

| Layer              | Holds                                                             | Files                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Pure functions** | Every derivation and transform. No React, independently testable. | `features/configure/lib/derive.ts`, `stores/persisted-schema.ts`, `lib/api/github-skills.ts`, the helpers exported from `added-skills-store.ts` |
| **Stores**         | Shared mutable state and the actions that write it.               | `config-store`, `ui-store`, `added-skills-store`                                                                                                |
| **Hooks**          | Reusable _behaviour_ — the only thing hooks are for here.         | `lib/use-pinned.ts`                                                                                                                             |
| **Components**     | Composition and event wiring only.                                | everything in `features/configure/components/`                                                                                                  |

Only three components hold a `useEffect` at all: the add-skill dialog (debounced search), the filter
bar (publishing pinned state), and the skill cell (outside-press / Escape dismissal). Each is
genuinely local to that component.

**Styling variants live in `packages/ui` as exported CVAs**, never re-typed at a call site. Where a
call site needs the look but not the semantics — the add-skill stage marker sits inside an
already-clickable row, so it must not nest a button — it consumes `chipVariants` directly rather
than duplicating the class list. Same for `matrixCellVariants`, which the options panel's ragged
sub-agent list reuses so the tri-state colours cannot drift from the matrix above them.

---

## 6. Sticky behaviour

The **page** scrolls, not the middle column: both side columns are `sticky top-0 h-svh`, which is
what makes their dividers read as continuous. `items-start` on the grid is what allows that.

`use-pinned.ts` reports whether a sticky element is _currently_ pinned — CSS has no selector for it.
It ships two forms, and which one to use is a performance decision, not a style one:

- **`usePinned`** returns React state. Only for elements whose own markup changes — the filter bar.
- **`usePinnedAttribute`** writes `data-pinned` straight to the DOM and never renders. For the
  domain headers, whose pinned state only drives a border but which each own a grid of skill cells.

The filter bar publishes its own state to a `data-bar-stuck` attribute on the document root, and the
headers re-pin beneath it (87px → 51px) in pure CSS — the design's own `.app.stuck .dom{top:51px}`.

**None of this may live in a store.** A shared `stuck` field puts every subscriber into the render
path for a value only a `top` offset and a border depend on. Measured with the full catalogue on
screen: an **88ms blocking task** at 240 cells (39ms at 97, none at 18), which is what made the
sticky transition read as a jump rather than an ease. Attribute-driven, it is 0ms and 60fps at every
cell count.

**The stuck state must not change the bar's height.** The design collapses a 60px top padding when
the bar sticks, which removes 78px of document height at the exact moment it pins; the browser's
scroll anchoring then compensates by moving the scroll position, un-pinning the bar and restoring
the padding — a measured oscillation (`scrollY` jumped 590 → 511). The 60px of air above the bar
therefore comes from the preceding hinge's bottom margin, only horizontal padding changes, and the
border is made transparent rather than removed. Geometry is identical; the feedback loop is gone.

Domain headers re-pin from `top: 87px` to `top: 51px` to follow the bar. The horizontal padding
transition is the **only** animation in the design.

## 7. Resolved decisions

Where the catalog and the design disagree, the catalog wins — the design was drawn against a smaller
snapshot of it.

| #   | Question               | Decision                                                                                                                                                        |
| --- | ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | **Domain set**         | Render all catalog domains as sections; chip only the five the design shows.                                                                                    |
| 2   | **Sub-agent taxonomy** | Real agents from the catalog (23, ragged), not the design's clean 4 × 4 of 16.                                                                                  |
| 3   | **Domain hierarchy**   | Ship `hierarchy: b` — 25px Inter title + amber `skills` suffix. The README prose describes the base rule; the prototype's default and every screenshot are `b`. |
| 4   | **Skill logos**        | Render the real mark where one exists, in `currentColor`; monogram otherwise.                                                                                   |
| 5   | **Domain colours**     | **Removed.** v5 has one accent; nine coloured dots would break rule 4.                                                                                          |

### Incompatibility

A skill is **out of reach** when the current selection makes it unusable, and the grid draws that by
dimming it to 40% and setting `aria-disabled`, never by hiding it. `selectReachability` in
`derive.ts` is the whole rule; it returns both what the selection has **reached** (chosen, plus what
that necessarily brings with it) and what is consequently out.

Where it comes from matters, because the obvious sources are both wrong:

| Field            | Why it is not the answer                                                                                                            |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `conflictsWith`  | Never leaves its own category — React lists only Vue/Angular/Solid/Svelte. It cannot express React ↔ SvelteKit at all.              |
| `compatibleWith` | Lists whole neighbourhoods rather than genuine pairings; it claims React **is** compatible with SvelteKit. Nothing derives from it. |
| `requires`       | **The real source.** Authored per skill with a reason — "SvelteKit is built on Svelte", "Pinia is Vue only".                        |

The rule runs in both directions, and needs both:

- **Forward** — a skill whose requirements can no longer be met goes with them:
  `SvelteKit → requires Svelte → conflicts with React`. Transitive (Pinia needs Vue _or_ Nuxt; Nuxt
  needs Vue; Vue is gone), so it runs to a fixpoint rather than one hop. Picking React puts 14 skills
  out of reach, only 4 of them by direct conflict.
- **Backward** — what the selection implies counts as selected. Choosing Next.js is choosing React
  whether or not React was clicked, so Angular, Vue, Svelte and SolidJS all go, even though Next.js
  names none of them. Only unambiguous groups propagate: "needs Vue _or_ Nuxt" cannot name which, so
  it implies neither.

Two exemptions keep it from trapping the user:

- **A selected skill is never disabled.** Clicking it off is the way out of a bad combination.
- **An exclusive sibling is never disabled** for conflicting with something _actually selected_ in
  its own category — picking one swaps rather than adds, so Vue stays live once React is chosen.
  Two things are deliberately outside that exemption, because in neither case would the swap help:
  a sibling whose own `requires` is unsatisfiable, and a sibling conflicting with a merely **implied**
  skill — clicking Angular would not evict Next.js, so the invalid pair would survive.

The cell keeps pointer events (it is `interactive={false}` + guarded handlers rather than
`pointer-events-none`) so the reason can still be read on hover; `title` carries it, which is also
the accessible description.

## 8. Adaptations — where the implementation departs from the design files

Each of these is a place the design could not be followed literally, with the reason.

| Area                             | Design                                                                                                                                        | Built                                                                                               | Why                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| **Sub-agent matrix**             | dev · pm · rev · test over Web/API/AI/CLI/Infra, `Meta ＋` folded beneath                                                                     | The same, and nothing else — verified against `screens/04-skill-panel.png`                          | The four ragged non-meta agents (web-architecture, web-pattern-critique, the two researchers) are deliberately **not** hand-assignable: the design draws INFRA straight into META, and the CLI is unifying every domain onto these four roles (`docs/subagents-todo.md`). They still take skills from a stack and still appear in the roster, where they can be switched off. Meta expands to its five agents — the design draws the row but leaves it static. |
| **Matrix gap cells**             | A plain 5 × 4 field; slots with no agent (AI pm/test, CLI pm, Infra dev/pm/test) look identical to unassigned ones                            | The same, but inert — no pointer cursor, no click                                                   | Fidelity to `04-skill-panel.png`, which shows uniform cells. Marking them (the earlier dashed treatment) invented a distinction the design does not draw.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Incompatible cell**            | `.skc.dis{opacity:.4}` — dimmed, and nothing else                                                                                             | The same 40% dim, plus `aria-disabled` and a reason on `title`                                      | The dimming matches the design exactly. What the design has no answer for is _why_ a cell is out, and that a mouse-only signal leaves the state unreadable to anything else — hence the reason and the ARIA state. A red outline was tried and pulled; see the todo.                                                                                                                                                                                           |

Configuring is not choosing: the `•••` and both badges never select. What they set on an unselected skill goes to `remembered` — the same place a deselected skill's setup goes — so it survives and `select` restores it verbatim. The panel shows `entry ?? remembered ?? freshEntry`, the same three fallbacks the store writes through, so it can never display one thing and save another.                                          |

## 9. Testing

Two layers, split by what each is good at.

| Layer                            | Covers                                                                     | Cost  |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----- |
| **Unit** (`vitest`, 94 tests)    | Pure logic: derivations, the persisted-schema boundary, the read model     | ~20ms |
| **E2E** (`playwright`, 88 tests) | Behaviour through a real browser: wiring, interaction, layout, persistence | ~16s  |

The split is not "units are better", it is **where a case is reachable**. Three things make a case
belong in a unit test:

- **The input space is combinatorial.** `isStackCustom` has six independent ways to flip and
  `selectDomainViews` crosses four filters with two provenances of skill. Each case is one browser
  round-trip end-to-end and microseconds in-process.
- **The path is a boundary against untrusted or legacy data.** `migrateConfig` and `pruneUnknownIds`
  read whatever localStorage happens to hold. This is the only place in the app where a bug is
  _silent_ — a broken migration does not throw, it quietly returns a configuration missing someone's
  afternoon of work. Reaching it end-to-end means hand-seeding a legacy blob and reloading.
- **Failure needs localising.** An E2E failure says the roster shows the wrong count; a unit failure
  says `summarize` counted an assignment where it should have counted an agent.

Everything else belongs in the browser, where a jsdom approximation would only be a weaker version
of the same assertion. `packages/vitest-config` ships a node preset for that reason: nothing under
unit test needs a DOM.

Both suites are verified non-vacuous by injecting regressions and checking that exactly the tests
naming the broken behaviour fail — see the tracker.

## 10. Deferred

| Item                    | State                                                                            |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Added-skill persistence | Session-only by explicit instruction. Needs a real marketplace entry to persist. |
| GitHub proxy            | `apps/server`. Unauthenticated search is 10 req/min, hence the 350ms debounce.   |
| Docs / Share / Settings | Route + centred heading only.                                                    |
| Empty / loading / error | Only the filter's no-match line and the dialog's error line exist. Undesigned.   |
| Responsive < 1324px     | Hard `min-w`; the page scrolls horizontally. Undesigned.                         |
| Dark mode               | Undesigned. The `.dark` block was removed rather than left stale.                |
