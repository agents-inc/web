// init --from <id>` fetches and validates it with this same schema. Canonical home is
// the CLI's shared package once that exists (D-239); until then this file is
// the source of truth and the CLI vendors it.

// Bump when the payload shape changes. Pre-release policy is discard-don't-
// migrate, so the schema accepts exactly one version: an id minted before a
// bump fails to decode loudly rather than being guessed at.

// v2 moved model and effort off the skill and onto the sub-agent, which is

// else's repo and has no business naming a model.

// v3 gave the sub-agent its scope. The CLI has carried one on every agent all
// along; the web had no surface for it, so `--from` wrote `project` for
// everyone. The field is additive-optional, which a version could not normally
// be needed for — but the CLI's vendored copy of this object strips what it
// does not know, so the version is what says the field is really there.
