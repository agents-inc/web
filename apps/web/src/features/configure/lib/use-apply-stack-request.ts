// What applying a `StackRequest` means, in one place. The grid applies
// directly when there is nothing to lose and the dialog applies once the
// switch is confirmed — two routes to the same dispatch, not two dispatches.
// The saved snapshot is why that matters: its payload becoming a selection
// through `fromSeedPayload` is a fact about the stored format rather than
// about either component, and this is the single site where the baseline
// `isStackCustom` measures edits against could later be repointed at that
// payload.
//
// An empty slot applies nothing. The grid offers the saved cell only while a
// snapshot exists, so a request that outlives one has nothing to restore.
