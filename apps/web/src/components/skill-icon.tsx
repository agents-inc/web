// The 26px logo slot. The design ships monograms everywhere and notes that
// real library logos belong in the same box once sourced — we have marks for
// roughly two thirds of the catalogue, so they render where they exist and the
// monogram fills in where they do not.
//
// The mark is drawn in `currentColor`, never its brand colour: design language
// rule 4 reserves colour for amber, and a wall of brand-coloured logos would
// drown the one signal the page uses to mean "you chose this". Selected cells
// tint the slot amber, which is the same rule working in the other direction.
//
// No fill: the slot sits directly on the cell. The design's `#f4f2ec` backing
// existed to give a bare monogram something to sit in; with real marks in the
// box it reads as a second surface competing with the cell itself.
